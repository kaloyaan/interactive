                    &nbsp;BULGARIAN TELEVISION ONLY SHOWED AMERICAN CARTOONS... BUT
                    SOMEHOW WE HAD A NU POGODI DVD AT HOME AND I REMEMBER BEING ODDLY
                    FASCINATED.. I KNEW IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE TOM & JERRY BUT
                    SOMETHING FELT OFF
                    I remember my mom humming the tune of nu pogody
                    everytime she would hear it either in public or in the tv at the
                    morning cartoons. And my mom’s voice is actually so soothing to
                    listen to that the mellowly singing is something that became very
                    related to the concept of childhood memories. 10 years later, I
                    introduced this show to my partner and almost got into tears even
                    though this wasn’t the cartoon of my childhood.
                    as a kid my favourite summer activity was watching "Nu Pogody" on repeat till around sunset; then outside while playing with my friends, we would try to catch each other and whenever I wasn't able to catch someone, I'd scream "Zayachhh, nu pogodi!!!"
                    Every time Nu Pogodi came on tv, my parrents would point out how great it was and I would see the glimmer of childish happiness in their eyes, as if they remembered their carefree days
                    When we were little my sister's favorite cartoon was "nu pogody" and up until today she reminds me about its episodes but I have almost no recollection of it even tho we were watching TV together all the time
                    i would always watch it while cuddling my dad, so it makes me feel very warm everytime i see it
