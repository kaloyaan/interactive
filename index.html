            <!--            <p>Hi my name is Kaloyan Kolev. I am 22 years old. I was born in Sofia, Bulgaria.<br>I go by Kalo. It's pronounced like 'Frida Kahlo'.<br>You can find out more about me on my <a href="http:kaloyankolev.com">personal website</a>!</p>-->
            <!--
            <img src="images/bio.png" alt="Kaloyan Kolev, also known as Kalo, was born in Sofia, Bulgaria in the year 2000. Growing up in the bustling city, Kalo was always drawn to the arts and creativity. Despite his parents' wishes for him to pursue a more conventional career, Kalo pursued his passion and studied fine arts in college.

During his time in college, Kalo discovered his talent for sculpture and quickly gained recognition for his unique and thought-provoking pieces. He participated in several exhibitions and soon became a well-known name in the local art scene.

However, Kalo wasn't content with just making a name for himself in Bulgaria. He wanted to share his art with the world and expand his horizons. In 2022, he moved to Paris to attend a prestigious art residency program. There, he met other artists from all over the world and was inspired by their different cultures and perspectives.

Kalo's time in Paris proved to be a turning point in his career. He was able to refine his craft and create some of his most meaningful work yet. His pieces caught the eye of a prominent art collector, who offered him a solo exhibition in New York City. Kalo jumped at the opportunity and moved to the city, where he has been making a name for himself ever since.

Today, Kalo is considered one of the most promising young artists in the world. He continues to push the boundaries of sculpture and is known for his thought-provoking pieces that comment on societal and political issues. He continues to live and work in New York, where he is constantly inspired by the city's energy and diversity." height="500">
